### Hot Swap / Hot Reload / Live Reload

- LiveReload - is immediate reflection of HTML/CSS file changes on the browser that the application is open at.

- HotSwap - is immediate implementation of the changes you make to the classes. Say the controller class. I would relate this with the classloader.

- HotReload - is automatic loading of the application when any changes detected. This is to avoid the developer's effort of stopping, re-starting the Spring Boot application manually.
